    INF   This workload is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of the device.   
          To further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.   
          Start by analyzing DRAM in the Memory Workload Analysis section.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 10.5 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to    
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 14.69 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.19 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible      
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per      
          warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          On average, each warp of this workload spends 106.7 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency  
          on a L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited  
          upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the        
          memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by        
          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently     
          used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 69.1% of the total average of 154.5 cycles       
          between issuing two instructions.

          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 15.85 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.06 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible      
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per      
          warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          On average, each warp of this workload spends 321.0 cycles being stalled waiting for the L1 instruction queue 
          for local and global (LG) memory operations to be not full. Typically, this stall occurs only when executing  
          local or global memory instructions extremely frequently. Avoid redundant global memory accesses. Try to      
          avoid using thread-local memory by checking if dynamically indexed arrays are declared in local scope, or if  
          the kernel has excessive register pressure causing spills. If applicable, consider combining multiple         
          lower-width memory operations into fewer wider memory operations and try interleaving memory operations and   
          math instructions. This stall type represents about 59.3% of the total average of 541.0 cycles between        
          issuing two instructions.

          On average, each warp of this workload spends 215.5 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency  
          on a L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited  
          upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the        
          memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by        
          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently     
          used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 39.8% of the total average of 541.0 cycles       
          between issuing two instructions.
